# Embracing the Past: Crafting a Nostalgic Instant Messenger Hobby Project

In a distant era, my companions and I embarked on an audacious voyage to fashion an instant messenger that would cater to the unique needs of the COVID-19 age within the confines of our startup. Our vision was bold: a multiplatform marvel, swift, secure, and efficient. With raw sockets, the might of C#, and the solidity of MongoDB, we forged ahead on the backend. In parallel, Java assumed the mantle for our Android client, becoming an integral part of the symphony we were composing together.

## Trials of Innovation

Our path wasn't devoid of challenges. As we navigated through the realm of desktop applications, we faced hurdles that seemed insurmountable. We dared to explore technologies such as WPF, JavaFx, and Electron, only to encounter setbacks that tested our resolve.

## A Journey of Evolution

Time surged forth, and with each passing year, we found ourselves evolving and adapting to the shifting landscapes of technology. We broadened our skill sets, embracing the ever-changing tapestry of the software development panorama.

## The Birth of Nostalgia

Amidst the ceaseless evolution of technology, a new calling beckoned meâ€”a calling born of nostalgia. A personal passion project that wasn't conceived as a direct extension of the past, but rather a vessel to capture the spirit of days gone by. This project is rooted in emotion, fueled by a yearning for a time when aspirations were unspoiled, and dedication was steadfast.

## A Symphony of Self-Reliance

In this endeavor, I've deliberately chosen to wield the raw tools of technology. While there are platforms and frameworks that offer turnkey solutions for personal instant messengers, I've chosen a different path. A path that involves crafting the fundamentals myself, rather than relying solely on prepackaged solutions. It's a nod to the past, a conscious decision to embrace the old ways, and to preserve the essence of what once was.

As I reflect on this journey, the timeless words of Harriet Tubman resound:

> "Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world."

*Here's to the dreams that inspire and the projects that bring them to life.*
