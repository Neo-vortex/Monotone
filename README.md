once upon time my firends and I decided to write a instante messanger in our startup to cover needs in covid 19 era.
we wanted it to be multiplatform, fast, secure and efficient. we were using bare sockets, C# and
mongodb for backend and java for the android client.
we tried some ways for porting it to desktop and all failed! we tried WPF,JavaFx and Electron.
Many years have passed since then and we all learned new technologies!
This is my hoby project aims to develope a simple implementation of what we all dreamed to make one day.
I am using technologies like ASPNET core, SignalR, Websockets and Flutter to reach a banalce between everything!

Good old days....
